    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Walter White, aka <b>"Heisenberg,"</b> is a chemistry whiz turned drug kingpin. What started as a noble quest to provide for his family quickly spiraled into a whirlwind of meth labs, explosions, and a questionable fondness for porkpie hats. Walter’s rise in the Albuquerque drug scene was meteoric, fueled by his 99.1% pure blue meth and an increasing disdain for moral boundaries.</p>
